# FPGA Learning projects

Included in this repo are multiple small projects that I have created in my quest to learn about FPGAs. If any of them get to be big projects I'll create separate repos for them and link them back here to get some semblence of history.

The directory structure is as follows:
root/FPGAfamily/project
